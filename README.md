## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
Used this resource to figure out how to center the text on the page https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_center.asp
Tried to use this resource to make it so that it generates random sequences everytime you play, but I couldn't figure it out https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random
Used this resource to figure out how to make the button text larger https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font_size.asp
Used this resource to find other colors for the buttons https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colornames.asp
Tried to use this resource to figure out how to make the background of the buttons an immage https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp
2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Something that I would like to know more about is the team aspect of web development. I want to know how teams collaborate in web developing projects. I am assuming that a large scale project is completed by more than
one person as it was with this project.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would spend those few more hours learning how to speed up the playback for each turn, learn how to randomize the sequence of patterns for every game, learn how to change the number of mistakes allowed, learn how to add
an image to the buttons, learn how to change the sound played for the buttons, and learn how to add a timer to the game.
